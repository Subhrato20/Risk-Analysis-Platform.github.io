# Disaster Risk Analytics Platform

## About the Project

Our project, "Disaster Risk Analytics Platform," is developed by a team aiming to provide comprehensive disaster risk analysis for investment firms operating within the U.S. markets. Using advanced statistical analysis and deep learning technologies, this platform helps predict potential disasters and their financial impacts on various states, aiding firms in making informed, resilient investment decisions.

### Project Type
**Advanced**

## Elevator Pitch

The Disaster Risk Analytics Platform leverages cutting-edge technology to transform uncertainty into a calculable risk. This tool is designed specifically for investment firms to enhance their ability to plan and prosper in volatile markets by providing strategic insights into disaster risks and their potential financial impacts.

## Features

- **Statistical Modeling:** Utilizes Poisson's distribution to accurately model the frequency of disaster events.
- **Deep Learning Integration:** Features an autoencoder for efficient data encoding and a custom deep learning-based regression model ("Regression Net") for financial damage estimation.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A Flask web application with an intuitive map interface allows users to interact with and visualize risk data effectively.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Hosted on AWS EC2 to ensure scalable and reliable access.

## Built With

- **Flask**: For backend framework.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For creating a responsive and interactive front-end.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: Powers the core analytics of the platform.
- **Autoencoders**: Used for data encoding and dimensionality reduction.
- **RegressionNet**: A custom deep learning model for estimating financial impacts.
